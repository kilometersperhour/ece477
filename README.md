# ECE477
### This is the repository where Miles, Jesse and Travis upload the source code for the labs of ECE477
-----------------------------------------------------
### Lab 01 - Sizes of Data Types:
In this lab we printed out the sizes of the following
data types: char, short, int, long, float and double

### Lab 02 - GPIO Exploration:
In this lab we designed a program which takes a
command line argument between 0-255 and makes LEDs on
GPIO pins correspondingly bright.
