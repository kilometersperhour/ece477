# ECE477
### This is the repository where Miles, Jesse and Travis upload the source code for the labs of ECE477
-----------------------------------------------------
### Lab 01 - Sizes of Data Types:
In this lab we printed out the sizes of the following
data types: char, short, int, long, float and double

### Lab 02 - Intro to GPIO Output:
In this lab we designed a program which takes a
command line argument between 0-255 and makes LEDs on
GPIO pins correspondingly bright.

### Lab 03 - GPIO-Based Transducer:
In this lab, the team designed, tested, and 
implemented a transducer which shows the average CPU
load (provided by the OS in /proc/loadavg) into a 
visible indicator on a logarithmic scale.

### Lab 04 - Intro to GPIO Input:
In this lab, the team was tasked with monitoring the
state of external pushbuttons to move an indicator 
(shown on LEDs). The refresh rate of the indicator
is once per 1024ms by default and the rate can be 
increased or decreased at the press of one of two 
buttons.
